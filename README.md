Working on Reactjs, Nextjs and any thing related to the lovely Frontend techs.

Your feedback on [VISI](https://github.com/sfwnisme/visi) Package helps me make it better.

## In progress...

- **Projects:** Working on a ticketing issues system for internal startups needs, I think it has frontend skills improvement potentials.
- **Package:** Implementing Reactjs [VISI](https://github.com/sfwnisme/visi) package that mirrors the Solidjs conditional rendering method. I think you should [have a look](https://github.com/sfwnisme/visi).
