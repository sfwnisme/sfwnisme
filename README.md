Your feedback on [VISI](https://github.com/sfwnisme/visi) Package helps me make it better.

## In progress...

- **Projects:** Working on a ticketing issues system for internal startups needs, I think it has frontend skills improvement potentials.
- **Package:** Using the creative Solidjs conditional rendering concept in Reactjs, that is what [VISI](https://github.com/sfwnisme/visi) is doing.
